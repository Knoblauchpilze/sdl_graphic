      // The process includes adjusting rows and columns by validating that

      // basis and should override the minimum hint provided by the items if it
      // is allowed by the constraints.
      // Typically let's figure some items with the following properties:
      //
      // Item 1:
      //  Min  : [100, 100]
      //  Hint : [150, 150]
      //  Max  : [200, 200]
      //
      // Item 2:
      //  Min  : [300, 100]
      //  Hint : [undefined]
      //  Max  : [undefined]
      //
      // Item 3:
      //  Min  : [110, 110]
      //  Hint : [120, 120]
      //  Max  : [150, 150]
      //
      // Item 4:
      //  Min  : [50, 50]
      //  Hint : [60, 60]
      //  Max  : [90, 90]
      //
      // All three items are supposed to land in a column with a minimum column
      // width of 130.
      // Let's also assume that the total size of the item allows to fit the items
      // without problem. We will not details the optimization process and consider that
      // the first assigned size is the final one.
      //
      // The first item will see its minimum size raised (please not that it will only
      // affect the computations inside this layout and not the actual minimum size of
      // this item) to [130, 130] and be assigned its hint anyway (of [150, 150]).
      //
      // The second item already has a minimum size larger than the minimum column
      // width so nothing will happen and it will be assigned a size based on the layout
      // preferred size (as no hint is provided).
      //
      // The third item has a minimum size smaller than the minimum column size so the
      // layout will try to raise the minimum size to [130, 130]. From there, we see that
      // it conflicts with the provided hint so there's too main case:
      // 1) The item's policy does allow to grow in which case the minimum size and the
      //    hint will be set to [130, 130].
      // 2) The item's policy does not allow to grow (which would be weird considered
      //    that the item has a maximum size) in which case the minimum size will be
      //    raised to [120, 120].
      //    The rest of the items though will still try to use [130, 130].
      //
      // The fourth item has a maximum size smaller than the provided minimum column
      // width. The logic will be the same as for the third item, except that the
      // maximum size will constraint the application of the minimum column width and
      // thus the maximum reachable size will be [90, 90] (if the policy allows to grow).

      // item, and then an adjustment phase where multi-cells items are placed.
      // In the first phase, the process is divided into two parts: the adjustment of
      // rows and columns is indeed completely independent and can be processed with no
      // particular ordering.
      // This allows for simpler algorithms.

      // take full advantage of this size (because their constraints forbid it) we
      // allocate the remaining space between remaining items until the achieved size
      // is close enough from the target size.

      // process and produce the best possible solution given the constraints.

      // scenario is that the items will take advantage of the computed repartition
